-- Question
-- 1. Join, because join performs better than subquery.


-- 2. CTE is for common table expression, and we will use it when we want to reuse or have a reference of a result set

-- 3. Table variable is a local variable storing data temporarily. The scope of table variable is only a single block. It will be stored in the temp table.

-- 4. DELETE will remove rows one by one and won't free the space, while TRUNCATE will simply remove all the rows in the table and it can free the space of the table. 
--	  TRUNCATE will perform better if we just want to clear the rows in a table

-- 5. Identity colomn is a possible way to generate key value in a table. DELETE won't affect the next value of the identity colomn, while TRUNCATE will reset the next value of identity colomn to the initial value.

-- 6. gdelete from table_nameh will delete all the rows one by one in the table but won't free the space, while gtruncate table table_nameh will remove all the rows and clear the space.

-- 11. Use CTE with ROW_NUMBER() function and PARTITION BY keyword so that the value of all the duplicate records in the new colomn with be large than 1, and we will delete all the rows based on the new colomn
